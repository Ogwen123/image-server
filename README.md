# üñºÔ∏è image-server
An custom server for hosting images. Made to be run on a raspberry pi but i don't see why it would work on everything else.

# Setup
To use the image server create a json file called ```kv.json``` in the src folder. This is where the key-value pairs for the image will be stored so the code from the url can be converted into a path, then create a ```config.json``` file in the src folder and copy 
```json
{
    "imageFolder": "",
    "port": 5000
}
```
into it and add the path to the folder you want the image to download to and be taken from into ```imageFolder```.

# Routes
Information on the servers routes.

## /upload
Uploads images to the server.   
The image must be submitted as a multipart-form and the key must be ```image```. The content type must also be set to ```image/{image_type}``` (e.g. ```image/png```). When you upload an image the server will try to assign it a code that is the file name minus the extension but if this is already taken it will assign it a randomly generated code.
