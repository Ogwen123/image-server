# üñºÔ∏è image-server
An custom server for hosting images. Made to be run on a raspberry pi but i don't see why it would work on everything else.

# Usage
To use the image server create a json file called ```kv.json``` in the src folder. This is where the key-value pairs for the image will be stored so teh code form the url can be converted into a path.

# Routes

## /image/view/{image_code}
returns the actual image
## /image/query/{image_code}
If the image exists it returns data about the image. If it doesn't exist it returns a 400 error.

## /images/filter
To all images matching the specified filter. Make sure the use the correct spelling and capitalization of the query strings when filtering.
