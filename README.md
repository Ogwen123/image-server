# image-server
An server for hosting images. Made to be run on a raspberry pi but i don't see why it would work on everything else.

# Usage
To use the image server create a json file called ```kv.json``` in the src folder. This is where the key-value pairs for the image will be stored so teh code form the url can be converted into a path.
